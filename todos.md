below are some 

I used paint to create a mockup with some changes, and to think about additional changes:
I added a visual description of what cards do in the top-right corner
I added an area dedicated to messages, warnings and suggestions about what to do next.
Decreasing the # of people on a task so that you can increase it on another one should be automated. First decrease something that is strictly worse than what you increase (Hunting vs Cooperative hunting), then other things. We display a message to say where they were taken from.
Population growth is missing.  If you have excess food, new people should be automatically added. If people starve for too long, population should decrease.
To keep cards simple and clear, they should have only one effect. For example complex hunting should only be a task that produces food.
Some if not all of story telling and cave painting should probably be tasks. Maybe even cooking. For example:
1 Lvl 3 person doing story telling educates 3 Lvl2 humans to Lvl 3.
1 person cave painting increases the output of 4 hunters by 50%
1 person cooking increases the food production by 5 (but cant do more than doubling it)
I think it should never be necessary to click twice on a new card to get it invented, unless you change your mind, so if your thoughts are already focused on a card, they stay focused on it when you find out what it is.
If your people are not focusing their thinking about anything, you first get a warning, then after a bit, a modal that just asks you wnat you want to focus on and you have to pick one.
To reduce the length of the prehistory era, we probably should remove complex hunting techniques and the hand axe,  They feel a bit redundant with cooperative hunting and the spear.
We probably don't need a modal & multiple choice question for every discovery,  Only for a few key ones
It's a bit frustrating (and consumes too much time) to try to optimize food production: either you produce too much and you soon get to full capacity, or you don't produce enough and your people starve. I feel like people could eat a bit more than they really need when there are enough reserves, so that there's always a sweet spot of # of food producing people where your reserves stay stable.
